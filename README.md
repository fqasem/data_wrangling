# Data Wrangling in Python
Data Wrangling is a crucial topic for Data Science and Data Analysis. Pandas Framework of Python is used for Data Wrangling. Pandas is an open-source library in Python specifically developed for Data Analysis and Data Science. It is used for processes like data sorting or filtration, Data grouping, etc.

Data wrangling in Python deals with the below functionalities:

## 1. Data exploration: 
In this process, the data is studied, analyzed, and understood by visualizing representations of data.
## 2. Dealing with missing values: 
Most of the datasets having a vast amount of data contain missing values of NaN, they are needed to be taken care of by replacing them with mean, mode, the most frequent value of the column, or simply by dropping the row having a NaN value.
## 3. Reshaping data: 
In this process, data is manipulated according to the requirements, where new data can be added or pre-existing data can be modified.
## 4. Filtering data: 
Some times datasets are comprised of unwanted rows or columns which are required to be removed or filtered

After dealing with the raw dataset with the above functionalities we get an efficient dataset as per our requirements and then it can be used for a required purpose like data analyzing, machine learning, data visualization, model training etc.
